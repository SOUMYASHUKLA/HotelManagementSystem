# HotelManagementSystem
This project implements different classes for a hotel management system in Java. 

The code assumes hotel rooms are booked for the month of June, 2022. 
Therefore the checkin and checkout dates should be in that range. 

There are 3 types of rooms to choose from and the system either books a room if available, or prompts the user for different selection.

To execute try the following (user inputs are in bold):

Welcome to Bookings.com!
Enter check-in Date for June-2022 (yyyy-MM-dd): 
**2022-06-02**

Enter check-out Date for June-2022 (yyyy-MM-dd): 
**2022-06-06**
